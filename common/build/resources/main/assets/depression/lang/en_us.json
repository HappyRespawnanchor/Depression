Besides I should prepare my equipment and supplies well later; after all I must teach those monsters a lesson tonight. ",
  "diary.depression.healthy_1.weather_rain": "The sound of rain is also interesting. A few moderate rains can also promote the growth of all things ... How beautiful. Shall I go out for a stroll? Anyway, I'm not worried about getting wet, and I can experience the fun of my childhood by the way. ",
  "diary.depression.healthy_1.breed": "By the way, a little livestock was born today. He looks as strong as his parents. ",
  "diary.depression.healthy_1.eat": "I don't expect eating something exquisite everyday, but today's meals are not bad. Thank God for giving me food to eat. ",
  "diary.depression.healthy_1.2": "Monsters wander outside as night falls. With courage surges in my heart,  scenes used to tremble me has nothing to be scared of now — I will show the monsters who's the hunter, and who's the prey. ",
  "diary.depression.healthy_1.kill_mobs": "Time for them to know my strength! The decaying smell of their bodies intensifies my desire to destroy them all... If they are really a part of this world, then let me conquer them together! ... Hahaha, the night's still long. ",
  "diary.depression.healthy_2.1": "There's countless days since my arrival ... At first, I didn't expect to adapt myself so quickly. When I woke up early today, I looked around. These are my achievement ... I have a territory that belongs to me in this uncivilized world. By the breeze past my ears, I'm able to witness the growth of everything ... ",
  "diary.depression.healthy_2.breed": "A new life has been born today. Awww he's cute XD ",
  "diary.depression.healthy_2.weather_clear": "It's rare to be so carefree and leisurely~ Strolling through my own territory, those monsters with nowhere to hide pose no threat to me at all. Let me plan my itinerary for today... Should I go down and mine some diamonds? Or go to the Nether and search for some ancient debris?  Alternatively, it could be, uhh... farming, fishing, or something else... Well, there's still a lot of time left, so let's think about it more slowly later. ",
  "diary.depression.healthy_2.weather_rain:": "It's the best time for a showering day in recent days. I can stay well in my small room and think about my future plans beneath the warm fire. This is also one of the rare easy times in busy days. ",

  "diary.depression.healthy_2.move_in_rain": "The monsters started wandering ... I happen to have a new idea; let's see if I have could trap one of them up and figure out how to make good use of it ... hehehe. But now they're bothering me a bit. Gotta' arm myself and “ask” them out of my territory first. ",
  "diary.depression.healthy_2.stay_in_house": "It's nice to stay at home occasionally ... So rainy outside, still comfortable to stay indoors. Hmm, I'd like to take a break first and have a cup of ... uh, if tea or such things exists in this world.",
  "diary.depression.healthy_2.2": "Unwittingly, it's getting dark and the monsters should have started to propagate. I took a really long break today. Today is so beautiful, surely I won't let those monsters ruin its end. So let me don my armor and have a few brandish with my blade ... ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_1.1": "I shook my head and tried throwing some unpleasant memories out of my mind. There're still much to do today, and working with a bad mood will affect my efficiency. I looked up at the flowers outside. They sway in the wind, as if they will wither at any time due to wind and rain. Sometimes I feel like I'm just another flower, just like them. ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_1.weather_clear": "I feel lethargic, maybe it's just that I didn't have much energy today. Compared to the hot sun high above the sky, I appear so insignificant. The animals are chattering again... Quite annoying, to be honest. Sigh ... forget about it. After all, I have to get on with my life. How I hope something good can happen today. ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_1.weather_rain": "Dang it, it's raining outside again. This temperature plus this humid air equals 100 percently uncomfortable. I cannot even determine whether it's dusk or noon, and maybe there will be random lightning bolts. Under this brightness the monsters will probably ready to start wriggling? And will a creeper silently ... No, I must try to think of some happy things ... AHHHH I JUST CAN'T MAKE IT ... The noise of rain and the whole environment make it difficult for me to think carefully. It's so annoying. SO ANNOYING. ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_1.move_in_clear": "Oh and i have to go outside and get myself awfully sweaty by such a hot sun. How hardworking the damn sun is. Can't it just go for a vacation? Or God could you please cover it with some thick clouds? ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_1.move_in_rain": "Oh and i have to go outside and get myself completely wet by such a heavy rain. Can't the cumulonimbus clouds just go for a vacation? Or God could you please just stop the rain today? ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_1.2": "Well, it's getting dark ... well, I can't just ignore the roar of those monsters. It's time to pick up a weapon and vent my frustrations this day. I don't know if it's just me, but my control of weapons seems become less proficient in recent days. No matter what, let's give these annoying guys a lesson first.",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_1.move": "These creatures can really run ... I've got nowhere to vent my anger. Come over here and taste my fury, jerks!",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_2.1": "Sore and drained is what I felt all over my body when I waked up... What's wrong with me? Even wielding a up a tool seems inadequate. Damn it... I can't do anything with an aching brain and a grotty body... Maybe I'd better rest well in bed. ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_2.weather_clear": "Highly hanged in the sky, the heat from the sun somehow gave me relax. At least there won't be that much monsters outside during daytime. Seems I'm filled with suspicions in recent days. Sometimes even harmless animals could startle me. And I'm unable to work as fast as before. Um and weird things appear in my sight occasionally. What has gotten into me ... ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_2.weather_rain": "Aww ... It's raining. Heavy-headed, I felt like I'm about to faint at any moment. Even outside was shrouded in gray. What should I do ... It will be dangerous if monsters appear. Immense helplessness makes me uneasy. But I can't even find out a single solution. Shadows covered and enveloped my entire body. And it feels like I'm suffocated. ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_2.eat": "I can barely swallow my food. And my mind's stuffed with garbage. ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_2.2": "Night has come. The most worried hours in a day. I held my weapon tightly with my head down. Damn it. I hope dawn could arrive immediately. I wanted to move my ass and have a death-fight with them, but I can clearly feel my ...  hesitation? My head is not functioning properly, and the darkness is everywhere ... Am I sick? The moans of monsters and what happened today made me daydream. Perhaps I really need the help of external theraping? ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_2.hurt": "Argh! Do they already know I'm in bad state? ... I raised my weapon and tried hard to overcome my fear. ",
  "diary.depression.moderate_depression_1.1": "Why is life so heavy? Lying in bed, I couldn't help but ask myself, I don't even have the courage to check what's outside. Is it fear? Or scare? This is the first time I feel helpless about what's unknown. Stumblingly out of bed. I know my life still need to live on.",
  "diary.depression.moderate_depression_1.kill_entities": "Killed something today. These creatures are just bothersome. ",
  "diary.depression.moderate_depression_1.weather_clear": "The sun is so dazzling. I can't even do some gathering effectively. Kinda like something in my heart is missing, and that hole's constantly sucking away something. Working in this state can be harder than usual, but fortunately, I can still muster some energy to survive, ... sometimes. ",
  "diary.depression.moderate_depression_1.weather_rain": "Rained again outside. Can't do anything today. The sound of rain is so annoying. I may like these white noises that aid sleep in my normal times, but now I feel nothing but annoying ... Although I need to fetch more for my liveplace but that means I have to go out and get soaked in the rain again. I've had enough of it. Could it just STOP ... ",
  "diary.depression.moderate_depression_1.eat": "Even food demand me work hard to swallow 'em. ",
  "diary.depression.moderate_depression_1.hurt": "Wounded today. I feel like this world is against me ... ",
  "diary.depression.moderate_depression_1.2": "The wilderness' filled with monsters every night. Suddenly I recalled the times when I first came to this world. I feel so loss. And unwell. Am I sick? Perhaps I really need some antidepressants ... ",
  "diary.depression.moderate_depression_1.mob_nearby": "Ahhhhh... monsters nearby. They're so close. I can even smell the suffocating breath on their bodies. Fear haunts my heart and I might wish I could survive tonight ... I just can't keep fighting with them like before. ",

The pressure of life makes me feel suffocated. I'm tired of living day after day. wha if something could kill me now   at least I don't have courage to say goodbye to this world yet. ",
  "diary.depression.moderate_depression_2.eat": "I don't know what's the point of eating since I can barely try sending sth to my mouth. i'd rather eat slimeballs ",
