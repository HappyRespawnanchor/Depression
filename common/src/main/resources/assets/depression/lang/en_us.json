  "diary.depression.healthy_2.1": "There's countless days since my arrival ... At first, I didn't expect to adapt myself so quickly. When I woke up early today, I looked around. These are my achievement ... I have a territory that belongs to me in this uncivilized world. By the breeze past my ears, I'm able to witness the growth of everything ... ",

Let me plan my itinerary for today... Should I go down and mine some diamonds? Or go to the Nether and search for some ancient debris?  Alternatively, it could be, uhh... farming, fishing, or something else... Well, there's still a lot of time left, so let's think about it more slowly later. ",

There're still much to do today, and working with a bad mood will affect my efficiency. I looked up at the flowers outside. They sway in the wind, as if they will wither at any time due to wind and rain. Sometimes I feel like I'm just another flower, just like them. ",
  "diary.depression.mild_depression_1.weather_clear":" I feel lethargic, maybe it's just that I didn't have much energy today. Compared to the hot sun high above the sky, I appear so insignificant.

  "diary.depression.mild_depression_1.weather_rain": "Dang it, it's raining outside again. This temperature plus this humid air equals 100 percently uncomfortable. I cannot even determine whether it's dusk or noon, and maybe there will be random lightning bolts. Under this brightness the monsters will probably ready to start wriggling? And will a creeper silently ... No, I must try to think of some happy things ... AHHHH I JUST CAN'T MAKE IT ... The noise of rain and the whole environment make it difficult for me to think carefully. It's so annoying. SO ANNOYING. ",

  "diary.depression.mild_depression_2.weather_clear": "Highly hanged in the sky, the heat from the sun somehow gave me relax. At least there won't be that much monsters outside during daytime. Seems I'm filled with suspicions in recent days. Sometimes even harmless animals could startle me. And I'm unable to work as fast as before. Um and weird things appear in my sight occasionally. What has gotten into me ... ",

I wanted to move my ass and have a death-fight with them, but I can clearly feel my ...  hesitation? My head is not functioning properly, and the darkness is everywhere ... Am I sick? The moans of monsters and what happened today made me daydream. Perhaps I really need the help of external theraping? ",

  "diary.depression.moderate_depression_1.1": "Why is life so heavy? Lying in bed, I couldn't help but ask myself, I don't even have the courage to check what's outside. Is it fear? Or scare?
